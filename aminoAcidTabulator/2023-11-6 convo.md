This was a weird request I got, and it reminded me of something from a long time ago that I can't recall. This will determine the number of amino acids in a list of protein IDs. I would assume you would weight these counts by relative abundance... but what your conclusions are will be beyond me. But maybe you could make statements about something like sulfur limitations? Who knows.

There are actually two scripts in this repo, one "fasta_to_table.py" will take a fasta and make a table of all the proteins in the fasta with each protein's amino acid composition. The second "proteins2aminoacids.py", and the important one, will do as described below. The test files are included, but keep in mind my "proteinList.txt" was made deliberately "bad" so I could see how it handled exceptions.

So, this script will take in two input files and export a single csv. The "proteinList.txt" fileis a text file with one column, no column header, which is a list of protein IDs. These can bewhatever unique identifier from your protein list, but they should be unique in the companionfasta. Also, it can be the complete fasta header, there are no limitations, but it will notmatch if it isn't in the fasta, and if it isn't unique, it will return more than one match.The second file is the fasta, "input.fasta" is the fasta used when generating the protein list.the resulting table will be each row is a protein entry with 22 columns following with countsof each of the amino acids in the protein. Homocysteine is not included as it does not have asingle letter amino acid code. If you have 442 protein IDs then your output_table.csv will have442 rows in addition to the column headers. These will be in the same order as the proteinList.txt.#You can change the name of the input files to whatever you have, but adjust the command appropriately. If there are spaces in the file names you will need to surround them with "".

To run this script from the command line, change directory to the directory containing both input filesand then execute the script with the following command:
```
python proteins2aminoacids.py proteinList.txt input.fasta output_table.csv
```

**Me**

Can you help me create a script that reads a fasta file and creates a flat table where the first column each entries' identifier (everything after '>'), followed by 22 columns that sum the number of each amino acid in that entry. I would like this resulting table exported and I want to run this script from the command line with input.fasta and output_table.csv arguments. Here are the possible 22 amino acid abbreviations:
A
R
N
D
C
E
Q
G
H
I
L
K
M
F
P
S
T
W
Y
V
U
O


**ChatGPT**

Certainly! You can create a Python script to read a FASTA file and generate a CSV table with the desired information. Here's a sample script for this task:

```
import sys
import re
import csv

# Function to count amino acids in a sequence
def count_amino_acids(sequence):
    amino_acids = {
        "A": 0, "R": 0, "N": 0, "D": 0, "C": 0, "E": 0, "Q": 0, "G": 0,
        "H": 0, "I": 0, "L": 0, "K": 0, "M": 0, "F": 0, "P": 0, "S": 0,
        "T": 0, "W": 0, "Y": 0, "V": 0, "U": 0, "O": 0
    }

    for aa in sequence:
        if aa in amino_acids:
            amino_acids[aa] += 1

    return amino_acids

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Usage: python fasta_to_table.py input.fasta output_table.csv")
    sys.exit(1)

input_filename = sys.argv[1]
output_filename = sys.argv[2]

data = []
current_sequence = ""
current_id = ""

# Read the input FASTA file
with open(input_filename, "r") as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        if line.startswith(">"):
            # A new entry starts
            if current_id:
                # Process the previous entry
                amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
                data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))
            current_id = line.strip()[1:]
            current_sequence = ""
        else:
            current_sequence += line.strip()

# Process the last entry
if current_id and current_sequence:
    amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
    data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))

# Write the data to the output CSV file
with open(output_filename, "w", newline='') as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acids.keys())
    writer.writerow(header)
    writer.writerows(data)

print(f"Processed {len(data)} sequences. Output saved to {output_filename}")
```

Save this script as fasta_to_table.py. You can run it from the command line with the following command:

```
python fasta_to_table.py input.fasta output_table.csv
```

Make sure to have the input FASTA file in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file. The script will create the output CSV file with the desired format, including the identifier and counts for each amino acid.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "fasta_to_table.py", line 52, in <module>
    header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acids.keys())
NameError: name 'amino_acids' is not defined


**ChatGPT**

I apologize for the oversight. It seems there was a variable naming issue in the script. You can fix it by changing amino_acids to amino_acids in the header line. Here's the corrected line:

```
header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acids.keys())
```

The corrected script is as follows:

```
import sys
import re
import csv

# Function to count amino acids in a sequence
def count_amino_acids(sequence):
    amino_acids = {
        "A": 0, "R": 0, "N": 0, "D": 0, "C": 0, "E": 0, "Q": 0, "G": 0,
        "H": 0, "I": 0, "L": 0, "K": 0, "M": 0, "F": 0, "P": 0, "S": 0,
        "T": 0, "W": 0, "Y": 0, "V": 0, "U": 0, "O": 0
    }

    for aa in sequence:
        if aa in amino_acids:
            amino_acids[aa] += 1

    return amino_acids

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Usage: python fasta_to_table.py input.fasta output_table.csv")
    sys.exit(1)

input_filename = sys.argv[1]
output_filename = sys.argv[2]

data = []
current_sequence = ""
current_id = ""

# Read the input FASTA file
with open(input_filename, "r") as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        if line.startswith(">"):
            # A new entry starts
            if current_id:
                # Process the previous entry
                amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
                data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))
            current_id = line.strip()[1:]
            current_sequence = ""
        else:
            current_sequence += line.strip()

# Process the last entry
if current_id and current_sequence:
    amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
    data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acids.values()))

# Write the data to the output CSV file
with open(output_filename, "w", newline='') as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acids.keys())
    writer.writerow(header)
    writer.writerows(data)

print(f"Processed {len(data)} sequences. Output saved to {output_filename}")
```

Now, the script should run without errors and create the desired output.


**Me**

I should have mentioned that the fasta file will have anywhere from one to many thousands of entries. Each entry has a header that starts with '>' and the following lines are the amino acid sequence of the protein, and then the next header would begin with a new line and '>'.


**ChatGPT**

The script I provided in my previous response should work for processing a FASTA file with multiple entries. It correctly reads the FASTA file, processes each entry, and generates a CSV table with the identifier and the amino acid counts for each entry.

You can use this script to process FASTA files with one or many thousands of entries. It will handle them sequentially, processing each entry and appending the results to the output CSV file.

Here's the usage of the script:

```
python fasta_to_table.py input.fasta output_table.csv
```

Make sure you have the input FASTA file with multiple entries, and the script will create a CSV file with the desired output for all entries.


**Me**

Thanks, just checking. I have the same error. Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "fasta_to_table.py", line 47, in <module>
    data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acids.values()))
NameError: name 'amino_acids' is not defined


**ChatGPT**

I apologize for the oversight in my previous responses. The error is indeed due to the variable name mismatch. You should change amino_acids to amino_acid_counts in the data.append line. Here's the corrected line:

```
data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))
```
The corrected script is as follows:

```
import sys
import re
import csv

# Function to count amino acids in a sequence
def count_amino_acids(sequence):
    amino_acids = {
        "A": 0, "R": 0, "N": 0, "D": 0, "C": 0, "E": 0, "Q": 0, "G": 0,
        "H": 0, "I": 0, "L": 0, "K": 0, "M": 0, "F": 0, "P": 0, "S": 0,
        "T": 0, "W": 0, "Y": 0, "V": 0, "U": 0, "O": 0
    }

    for aa in sequence:
        if aa in amino_acids:
            amino_acids[aa] += 1

    return amino_acids

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Usage: python fasta_to_table.py input.fasta output_table.csv")
    sys.exit(1)

input_filename = sys.argv[1]
output_filename = sys.argv[2]

data = []
current_sequence = ""
current_id = ""

# Read the input FASTA file
with open(input_filename, "r") as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        if line.startswith(">"):
            # A new entry starts
            if current_id:
                # Process the previous entry
                amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
                data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))
            current_id = line.strip()[1:]
            current_sequence = ""
        else:
            current_sequence += line.strip()

# Process the last entry
if current_id and current_sequence:
    amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
    data.append([current_id] + list(amino_acid_counts.values()))

# Write the data to the output CSV file
with open(output_filename, "w", newline='') as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acid_counts.keys())  # Use the keys from the last entry
    writer.writerow(header)
    writer.writerows(data)

print(f"Processed {len(data)} sequences. Output saved to {output_filename}")
```
Now, the script should run without errors and create the desired output for multiple entries in the FASTA file.


**Me**

Awesome, so that totally worked. Now I want to built off this concept with another script that is going to have two input files: proteinList.txt and input.fasta. The proteinList.txt will be a single column of identifiers that will be contained in the entry header sequence (the string following '>'), and it does not have a column header. In this new script I want the output_table.csv to only contain the fasta entries contained in the proteinList.txt, and in the same order as the proteinList.txt, and then contain the same 22 columns of amino acids and their counts per entry (same as before). I hope you can build off the prior script, but maybe call it proteins2aminoacids.py.


**ChatGPT**

Sure, I can help you create a new script called proteins2aminoacids.py that takes two input files: proteinList.txt and input.fasta. The script will generate an output CSV file, output_table.csv, containing only the FASTA entries specified in proteinList.txt, with the same 22 columns of amino acids and their counts per entry.

Here's the proteins2aminoacids.py script:

```
import sys
import re
import csv

# Function to count amino acids in a sequence
def count_amino_acids(sequence):
    amino_acids = {
        "A": 0, "R": 0, "N": 0, "D": 0, "C": 0, "E": 0, "Q": 0, "G": 0,
        "H": 0, "I": 0, "L": 0, "K": 0, "M": 0, "F": 0, "P": 0, "S": 0,
        "T": 0, "W": 0, "Y": 0, "V": 0, "U": 0, "O": 0
    }

    for aa in sequence:
        if aa in amino_acids:
            amino_acids[aa] += 1

    return amino_acids

if len(sys.argv) != 4:
    print("Usage: python proteins2aminoacids.py proteinList.txt input.fasta output_table.csv")
    sys.exit(1)

protein_list_filename = sys.argv[1]
input_filename = sys.argv[2]
output_filename = sys.argv[3]

# Read the list of protein identifiers from proteinList.txt
with open(protein_list_filename, "r") as protein_list_file:
    protein_identifiers = [line.strip() for line in protein_list_file]

# Initialize a dictionary to store the protein identifiers and their corresponding amino acid counts
protein_data = {}

current_sequence = ""
current_id = ""

# Read the input FASTA file
with open(input_filename, "r") as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        if line.startswith(">"):
            if current_id and current_id in protein_identifiers:
                # If the current identifier is in the list, process it
                amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
                protein_data[current_id] = list(amino_acid_counts.values())
            current_id = line.strip()[1:]
            current_sequence = ""
        else:
            current_sequence += line.strip()

# Process the last entry
if current_id and current_id in protein_identifiers:
    amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
    protein_data[current_id] = list(amino_acid_counts.values())

# Write the data to the output CSV file
with open(output_filename, "w", newline='') as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    header = ["ID"] + list(amino_acids.keys())
    writer.writerow(header)

    # Write the data in the order specified by the proteinList.txt
    for protein_id in protein_identifiers:
        if protein_id in protein_data:
            writer.writerow([protein_id] + protein_data[protein_id])

print(f"Processed {len(protein_data)} sequences. Output saved to {output_filename}")
```
Save this script as proteins2aminoacids.py. You can run it from the command line with the following command:

```
python proteins2aminoacids.py proteinList.txt input.fasta output_table.csv
```
Make sure to have the proteinList.txt and input.fasta files in the same directory as the script or provide the correct paths to these files. The script will generate the output_table.csv file containing the specified protein entries and their amino acid counts in the order of proteinList.txt.

**Me**

That almost worked perfectly. I think I wasn't clear that the identifiers on each row of the proteinList.txt will not exactly match the fasta header, and may only match part of the string.


**ChatGPT**

I see, if the identifiers in proteinList.txt may only partially match the FASTA headers, you can modify the script to use a partial match strategy. Here's an updated script that will consider a match if the identifier in proteinList.txt is contained within the FASTA header:

```
import sys
import re
import csv

# Function to count amino acids in a sequence
def count_amino_acids(sequence):
    amino_acids = {
        "A": 0, "R": 0, "N": 0, "D": 0, "C": 0, "E": 0, "Q": 0, "G": 0,
        "H": 0, "I": 0, "L": 0, "K": 0, "M": 0, "F": 0, "P": 0, "S": 0,
        "T": 0, "W": 0, "Y": 0, "V": 0, "U": 0, "O": 0
    }

    for aa in sequence:
        if aa in amino_acids:
            amino_acids[aa] += 1

    return amino_acids

if len(sys.argv) != 4:
    print("Usage: python proteins2aminoacids.py proteinList.txt input.fasta output_table.csv")
    sys.exit(1)

protein_list_filename = sys.argv[1]
input_filename = sys.argv[2]
output_filename = sys.argv[3]

# Read the list of protein identifiers from proteinList.txt
with open(protein_list_filename, "r") as protein_list_file:
    protein_identifiers = [line.strip() for line in protein_list_file]

# Initialize a dictionary to store the protein identifiers and their corresponding amino acid counts
protein_data = {}

current_sequence = ""
current_id = ""

# Read the input FASTA file
with open(input_filename, "r") as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        if line.startswith(">"):
            if current_id and any(identifier in current_id for identifier in protein_identifiers):
                # If the current identifier partially matches any in the list, process it
                amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
                protein_data[current_id] = list(amino_acid_counts.values())
            current_id = line.strip()[1:]
            current_sequence = ""
        else:
            current_sequence += line.strip()

# Process the last entry
if current_id and any(identifier in current_id for identifier in protein_identifiers):
    amino_acid_counts = count_amino_acids(current_sequence)
    protein_data[current_id] = list(amino_acid_counts.values())

# Write the data to the output CSV file
with open(output_filename, "w", newline='') as output_file:
    writer = csv.writer(output_file)
    header = ["ID"] + list(protein_data[next(iter(protein_data))])
    writer.writerow(header)

    # Write the data in the order specified by the proteinList.txt
    for protein_id in protein_identifiers:
        for header, counts in protein_data.items():
            if protein_id in header:
                writer.writerow([header] + counts)

print(f"Processed {len(protein_data)} sequences. Output saved to {output_filename}")
```
This script will match the identifiers in proteinList.txt partially with the FASTA headers and process them accordingly.


**Me**

That did it, and actually works really well with the unintended benefit that this can match multiple entries if they share the same protein name. I would recommend people use a unique identifier in the proteinList.txt. Thank you for you help.


**ChatGPT**

You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that the script is working well for your needs, and that it has the flexibility to match multiple entries with shared protein names. You're absolutely right; using unique identifiers in proteinList.txt is a good practice to ensure accuracy.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy scripting!
